# Tech Stack used
I built this app using the MERN stack. I was taking the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann nodejs bootcamp course</a>, in which I completed.\
Much of the back-end comes from the course, other than some modifications I've made. I made some of those modifications in the controllers,routes, and in the schema model.\
Also the front-end design for the homepage was inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann original homepage design,the rest of the pages are original designs by me.\
For authentication of the app, JSON web tokens were used.
